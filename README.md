# HISPlayer Unity WebGL SDK

HISPlayer is the most advanced Unity video streaming player for WebGL, supporting Video on Demand (VOD) and live contents. It enables premium DASH and HLS video streaming inside your Unity WebGL games and apps across all web browsers in any device. We include advanced features such as multistream / multiview, ad insertion (SSAI, SGAI & CSAI), or automatic bitrate adaptation to secure the best video quality. You can use the HISPlayer's WebGL Video Player component to control how to time video playback relative to other interactive behaviors in WebGL metaverses or games.
